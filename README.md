# Economic-Development
Based on open source remote sensing data and deep learning technology, this paper proposes an unsupervised method for estimating China's grid scale development index. This method consists of four steps: feature extraction, feature clustering, model training based on ranking learning and index assignment. It has the characteristics of easy data acquisition and interpretability of the model, and provides a new idea for the research on China's fine-grained social development level. 
## Data Collection
The data we use for training includes daytime remote sensing image and nighttime light image. The collection method is shown in the /DataCollection/data_guide.ipynb.
## Model Training
Train the model and extract the score.
